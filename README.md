This repository contains additional resources that were used during preparation of the manuscript. These include custom software and data files.

## Software: SHAPE_Trimmer
A Python script for trimming sequences bound by primers and concatenation of truncated files. To run the script properly, it must be executed in the same directory as the FASTQ files to be trimmed.
Specifically, this script performs
- truncation of sequences in .fastq files for target BVDV IRES RNA zones as required for SHAPE-MaP
- concatenation of truncatated files into a common file for complete sequence coverage

- define input/infiles files (EDIT AS NEEDED for number of zones)
- name output filename (EDIT AS NEEDED)
- hybridization site lengths for respective primers for 3 RNA zones; these correspond to the length of primers; indices match infiles
- trimming and merging

## Data files
The *stk* directory contains Stockholm files of structural multiples sequence nucleotide alignments that were used to
- compare published BVDV IRES RNA structures
- compute consensus structures
